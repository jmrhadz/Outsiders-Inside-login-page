The Assignment:
 
    Using create-react-app, create a new React project. Create a LoginForm component that contains the following:
        Username and password input fields, an h3 that says Log In, with a border.
    Style the component using the default generated CSS file.
    Create a Navigation component that contains links styled like a navbar.
        The links donâ€™t have to go anywhere.
    Put the Navigation component at the top of the page and the LoginForm in the center of the page.


TODO:
    Add a welcome page on button click that displays the username.
    Make the Navbar feel like a navbar, with a dropdown menu, or at least background color changes.
    Make reset password and user registration forms.
